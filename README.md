# FlapPy Bird

A Flappy Bird clone written in Python using pygame.

# Requirements

Requires `Python 3.10+` and is tested on `pygame 2.5.2`.

You can just run `pip -r requirements.txt` to install pygame and
then run `main.py` with your own Python shell.

There is a script called `init-venv.sh` that will initialize and create a
virtual environment for the game incase you use other versions of pygame. 
You can use it with `source init-venv.sh`  and then run the game with `./main.py`.
